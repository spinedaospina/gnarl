# Go to [Eric´s repository,](https://github.com/ecc1/gnarl) if you are searching a clean code

Basically I am "destroying" this code for a better understanding, I am giving a comment for each line in the code because C is new for me. I really wanna help (or at least understand) this proyect and this is my way.

If you are getting stucked in the understanding of the Eric´s code, check here if I have a comment about the performance of this specific line (or code block), If doesn´t so… we are stucked together.
